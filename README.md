# Web app for banana genes database

This database contains genetic and genomic data for the three families of banana genes. It is to facilitate the cooperation and sharing of information between the local scientists group. 

The development included the use of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin, MySQL database, and interface using PHP and HTML. 

It was a project in my undergraduate course, Database Systems that sharpened my skills in Database System Development Lifecycle (DSDLC) and entity-relationship modelling.
