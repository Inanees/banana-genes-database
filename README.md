# Web app for banana genes database

This database contains genetic and genomic data for the three families of banana genes. It is to facilitate the cooperation and sharing of information between the local scientists group. 

The development included the use of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin, MySQL database, and interface using PHP and HTML. 

It was a project in my undergraduate course, Database Systems that introduced me to Database System Development Lifecycle (DSDLC) and entity-relationship modelling.

## Self-reflection
This was one of my earliest projects and there is a lot that I can improve on. Overall, I have improved a lot more since this project.
