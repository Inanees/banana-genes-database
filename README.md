# Web app for banana genes database

This database contains genetic and genomic data for the three families of banana genes. It is to facilitate the cooperation and sharing of information between the local scientists group. 

The development included the use of XAMPP, phpMyAdmin, MySQL database, and interface using PHP and HTML. 

It was a project in my undergraduate course, Database Systems that introduced me to Database System Development Lifecycle (DSDLC) and entity-relationship modelling.

This project used confidential data received from a local scientists group, who were kind enough to let students like me to practice with when developing an online database. Hence, the database, details and information regarding the data was excluded from this repository.

## Self-reflection
This was one of my earliest projects and there is a lot that I can improve on. Overall, I have improved a lot more since this project.
